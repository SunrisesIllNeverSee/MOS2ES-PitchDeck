## 📊 Deck Audit — Strengths, Weaknesses, Recommendations

### ✅ Strengths
- **Strong framing:** The *Four Towers vs Four Rings* metaphor makes the problem/solution contrast clear.  
- **Legitimacy signals:** Solo build stats + token usage show traction and seriousness.  
- **Coverage:** Includes team, vision, problem, solution, and roadmap — all major pitch deck beats.  
- **Tone:** Dense but professional. Reads like sovereign IP, not a hackathon slide.

### ⚠️ Weak Spots
- **Slide density:** Some slides (esp. *Tech Silos*) cram too many billion-dollar vectors at once (context, provenance, eval, deployment).  
- **Timeline buried late:** Roadmap and “next steps” come too far at the end.  
- **Contact branding:** Lists personal email + raw GitHub URL instead of a clean domain.

### 🛠 Recommendations
- **Split crowded slides:** Break *Tech Silos* into two slides for readability.  
- **Move roadmap forward:** Place “Next Steps / Timeline” right after *MOS²ES Solutions*.  
- **Polish contact slide:** Swap to a business email + domain (even a simple redirect placeholder works).
